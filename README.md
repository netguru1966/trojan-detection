<h1 align="left">Trojan Detection</h1>


<h4 align="left">A Trojan is an active and prominent malware, first emerged on the cybersecurity landscape in 2010 and has maintained a persistent botnet infrastructure ever since. 

The emergence and increasing prevalence of Malware as a Service (MaaS) has become a notable trend within the current cyber threat landscape. MaaS has gained popularity as a common tool in the arsenal of threat actors, enabling them to conduct and facilitate widespread cyberattack campaigns.

Malware as a Service refers to a model where cybercriminals offer malware-related services or resources for rent or purchase to other malicious actors. This approach provides several advantages to both skilled and novice attackers.

Trojans are among the prevalent forms of malware that utilize MaaS to deliver multiple malwares, updated copies of itself, and various Amadey plugins or attacks designed for information theft. The figure below illustrates a basic diagram of how Amadey attempts to compromise systems and download several malwares or its plugins for data collection and exfiltration.</h4>

</p>

<h4 align="left">
The data can be used to detect the Trojan Horse Traffic. The data contains the records of the traffics like Trojan Horse and Benign so the detection of Trojan and Benign can be done using Binary Classification. The data is originated from CIC website. The number of samples that are recorded in the dataset are as follows:

<b></b>

 * Trojan Data with 90683 Observations
 * Benign Data with 86799 Observations</h4>

<h2 align="left">Terminology</h2>

   * Dataset: A set of data examples, that contain features important to solving the problem.
   * Features: Important pieces of data that help us understand a problem. These are fed in to a Machine Learning algorithm to help it learn.
   * Model: The representation (internal model) of a phenomenon that a Machine Learning algorithm has learnt. It learns this from the data it is shown during training. The model is the output you get after training an algorithm. For example, a decision tree algorithm would be trained and produce a decision tree model.</h3>


<h2 align="left">Process</h2>

   1. Data Collection: Collect the data that the algorithm will learn from.
   2. Data Preparation: Format and engineer the data into the optimal format, extracting important features and performing dimensionality reduction.
   3. Training: Also known as the fitting stage, this is where the Machine Learning algorithm actually learns by showing it the data that has been collected and prepared.
   4. Evaluation: Test the model to see how well it performs.
   5. Tuning: Fine tune the model to maximise itâ€™s performance.
